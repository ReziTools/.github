# ReziTools

## Building next-generation open-source tools for engineering.

We are a group of engineers, developers and students building tools for engineering.

Our main project is ReziSim, a web based mechanical load simulator.

Out currently unreleased and planned projects include:
- ReziEngine
The predecessor of ReziSim, built as a native application with optional web support.
- ReziDraw
A direct modeling 2D CAD program.
- ReziEpura
A program for creating sketches centered around the epure projection method.
- ReziConstr
A C++11 library for solving geometric contraints.
- ReziMath
A C++11 template library for vector and matrix math optimized for graphical programming.
- ReziLinear
A C++11 template library for linear algebra.
- ReziGPU
A C99 abstraction layer for OpenGL3.3/OpenGL4.6/GLES2.0/WebGL.
- ReziGUI
A C++11 declarative GUI framework for ReziGPU-based applications.
- ReziPack
A C99 resource file embedder with caching.
